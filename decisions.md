## D-17 · 2026-10-01 · PLP keeps numbered pagination over a "Load more" button

**Context**: The brief's PLP section lists "Load more with count"; the rebuilt PLP ships server-rendered numbered pagination (`catalog-pagination.tsx`) with a visible result count.

**Decision**: keep **URL-driven pagination**. Every facet is a URL param (`q/category/brand/minPrice/maxPrice/resolution/availability/minRating/sort/page` — frozen contract), so a page number is shareable, back/forward-safe, SEO-crawlable and renders fully server-side without client fetch choreography. A "Load more" flow either duplicates the grid in client state (double DOM for 100+ SKUs) or becomes a client-side merge that breaks facet-change semantics; the count requirement is already satisfied by the `aria-live` "N products" row. If the owner wants Load more later, it belongs on top of the same facet contract as a progressive enhancement, not a replacement.

**Rejected**: client-side Load-more merge state (facet changes would need manual grid reconciliation); infinite scroll (breaks footer access + back-button expectations; worse for conversion clarity).

## D-16 · 2026-10-01 · Storefront design system re-based on the live reference — measured values beat the brief's generic numbers

**Context**: Owner directive: full teardown + rebuild with neemans.com as the structural source of truth ("failure condition: looks like a generic template, OR doesn't follow the reference's structure"). The brief's DESIGN SYSTEM block also carries generic numbers (container 1440, button radius 8, section rhythm 48/80–96).

**Decision**: the design DNA comes from the **live capture** (`docs/REFERENCE-BLUEPRINT.md`): greige `#f3f2ee` canvas, white surfaces, ink text, caramel `#c99a55` CTA, sand bands, deep-green success/sale accents, star tone, whisper shadows, pill buttons/chips, `lg` cards, `container-inner` = 1280, section rhythm 48/64, motion 150–300 ms ease-out transform+opacity only — the storefront is motion-quiet (parallax retired from it). Dark mode re-tuned to the same DNA (forest-tinted canvas, caramel CTA; replaces the old trust-pine block; D-9's manual-toggle/token-first rules unchanged). **Documented deviations from the brief's generic numbers**, each because reference fidelity is the brief's own top priority: container **1280** (reference-measured, not 1440); button radius **pill** (reference DNA, not 8); section rhythm **48/64** (not 48/80–96); announcement cadence **4s with hover+focus pause** (brief A — applied in Task 51.1); sticky nav **hides on scroll down / returns on scroll up** (brief B — applied in Task 51.1, suppressed while mega/search/drawers are open); card rating **only at count ≥ 5** (brief card rule — applied in Task 51.1).

**Rejected**: the brief's generic 1440/8px system (would re-introduce the generic-template look the brief itself fails); keeping parallax on storefront bands (violates the motion-quiet reference behaviour); re-skinning old components instead of the rebuild the owner ordered.

## D-15 · 2026-09-27 · Volumetric seed is deterministic, batched, and covers every table

**Context**: Owner asked to "seed a lot of data in neon db in every table" — the client-facing Render deploy was showing empty dashboards/reports because the seed covered only catalog + users (~20 of 38 tables had rows).

**Decision**: seed.ts gains a volumetric phase driven by `mulberry32(20260927)` — a fixed PRNG seed makes every reseed rebuild the **identical** dataset (stable screenshots, comparable QA runs). Coverage target is every table: 51 buyers/106 addresses, 182 orders across all 13 statuses & 6 months, payments + gateway events, shipments + tracking events, returns, coupon redemptions, reviews, carts, wishlists, stock alerts, B2B inquiries, OTP trail, audit log, and the full stock-monitor lifecycle (count sessions → applied variances → real movements). All writes are batched `createMany`/`createManyAndReturn` (~50 round trips, not ~3,600 per-row inserts). Invariants kept: money integer paise; GST back-computed from GST-inclusive line prices (CGST/SGST Gujarat, IGST otherwise); order numbers match the app's `PN-YYYY-NNNNNN` format; orders never decrement Inventory (demo low/OOS states survive); unique constraints guarded in-memory. Idempotent via the existing clean-phase — rerunning `bun run db:seed` on Neon is safe.

**Rejected**: `Math.random` data (unreproducible across reseeds — breaks before/after screenshots); per-row `create()` loops (minutes of network latency to Neon vs ~1 min batched); SQL dumps for seeding (provider-fragile, bypasses Prisma typing and the hashPassword/settings service hooks); auto-decrementing inventory to mirror orders (would erase the deliberate low/out-of-stock demo states).

## D-14 · 2026-09-27 · Standalone start pins HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 (Render's HOSTNAME trap)

**Context**: The Render deploy served 502 despite a green build: Render injects `HOSTNAME` (the service hostname) into the environment, and Next's standalone server binds to `process.env.HOSTNAME` — an unreachable interface. The owner's dashboard start command (`HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 PORT=$PORT NODE_ENV=production bun .next/standalone/server.js`) fixed it live; the repo's `npm run start` did not yet carry the fix, so a Blueprint re-apply or fresh deploy would regress.

**Decision**: bake the binding into the repo script: `start` = `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 PORT=${PORT:-3000} NODE_ENV=production node .next/standalone/server.js`. `render.yaml` keeps `startCommand: npm run start` (now equivalent to the dashboard's bun variant — bun ships in Render's Node image and is verified working there, but node exists on every runtime). The Docker runner already pinned `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` via ENV since Task 3-b, so all three deployment paths (Node/Blueprint, dashboard override, Docker) now agree.

**Rejected**: leaving the fix dashboard-only (per-service settings are invisible in the repo and resurrect the 502 on re-apply); switching the repo script to bun (the Docker/VPS path has no bun); hardcoding PORT (Render assigns `$PORT` per service).

*Full post-mortem: [`docs/incidents/2026-09-27-render-502-proxy-unreachable.md`](docs/incidents/2026-09-27-render-502-proxy-unreachable.md) — timeline, root-cause mechanics, recurrence playbook, lessons learned.*

## D-13 · 2026-09-27 · Runtime DB is Neon PostgreSQL — repo provider flipped, scripts made env-proof

**Context**: Owner provisioned a Neon Postgres instance and asked to drop SQLite ("stop using your sqlite db and switch to this") because the site is going to Render in a Node environment for client viewing. The schema was already 100% provider-portable (D-12's JSON-column choice included), so the flip touches configuration, not models.

**Decision**: (1) `prisma/schema.prisma` is now `provider = "postgresql"` in-repo (the Dockerfile sed stays as a documented no-op safety net). (2) **Every DB-touching npm script routes through `scripts/with-env.sh`** (dev/db:push/db:sync/db:seed) — the shim sources `.env` **over** the inherited environment when `.env` exists (sandbox: its session injects a stale `DATABASE_URL=file:…`, and OS env beats `.env` files), and passes the inherited environment through untouched when it doesn't (Render: dashboard env only). *Amended Task 28: the first cut used `env -u DATABASE_URL`, which broke the Render build (P1012 — on Render there is no `.env`, so stripping the var left nothing). The shim is the corrected, two-worlds-correct mechanism.* (3) `start` uses plain `node .next/standalone/server.js` (Render Node runtime has no bun). *(Amended by D-14: start now pins HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 PORT.)* (4) New `db:sync` script (`prisma db push` **without** `--accept-data-loss`) is the Render build step — destructive schema changes fail the deploy loudly instead of eating data. (5) Seed clean-phase now also clears `otp_verifications` + the three stock-monitor tables — Postgres enforces FKs strictly and this keeps reseeds idempotent. (6) `package-lock.json` (lockfileVersion 3, 951 pkgs) committed so Render npm builds are reproducible. SQLite remains a documented fallback (flip provider + `file:` URL).

**Rejected**: keeping SQLite in dev (the owner's deployment target shares the Neon DB; one source of truth removes the recurring sandbox-wipe class of bugs); pooled Neon endpoint now (single long-running server doesn't need it — documented for future scaling); Prisma migrations (repo strategy remains `db push`, unchanged).

## D-12 · 2026-09-27 · Role overhaul: Owner + dynamically-scoped Staff (fixed roles removed)

**Context**: Owner's spec — the store owner has full permissions **including changing their own login and creating other superadmins**; the general `ADMIN` role is removed; **every other operator role becomes Staff whose scope the owner sets at account creation via a wizard** ("which functions u want this staff to have").

**Decision**: (1) **Two operator roles**: `SUPER_ADMIN` (Owner — implicitly passes every gate; can change own email/password with current-password confirmation; can create more superadmins) and `STAFF` (scope lives in a new `User.permissions` JSON column — 15 validated scope keys, one per console section). Legacy fixed roles (`ADMIN`, `INVENTORY_MANAGER`, `ORDER_MANAGER`, `CONTENT_MANAGER`) are deleted from the model; an idempotent `scripts/migrate-legacy-roles.ts` maps existing rows to STAFF + scope. (2) **DB-fresh permission gates**: `requirePermission(scope)` / `requireOwner()` re-read the operator row per request, so scope edits and deactivations apply on the staff's **next request without re-login**; all admin routes moved off fixed role lists. Panel layout mirrors the gates server-side (deep links into non-granted sections bounce to the staff's first granted section; `/admin` dashboard is Owner/scope-less-staff only). (3) **Wizard over forms**: `/admin/staff` (owner-only) has a 3-step creation flow — identity → account type (Staff / Superadmin) + grouped function checkboxes with role presets → review — plus per-account editing (rename, password reset, scope change, deactivate). (4) **Dead-session escape hatch**: `GET /admin/logout` clears stale-but-valid JWTs (user wiped/recreated), breaking the proxy↔layout redirect loop found during E2E.

**Rejected**: keeping a general ADMIN role "for convenience" (the whole point is least-privilege by default); encoding scopes in the JWT (stale until re-login — violates live-edit requirement); storing scopes as a scalar list (SQLite has no scalar lists — JSON column instead); deleting legacy users outright (audit history must keep attributing).

## D-11 · 2026-09-27 · Role display naming: the owner reads "Owner", not "Super Admin"

**Context**: Owner asked "so you have named superadmin as manager (basically store owner who has ALL the permissions)" — their mental model is Owner-first, but the UI rendered `SUPER_ADMIN` as "SUPER ADMIN" and the account as "Platform Superadmin", while the "Manager" word actually belonged to the scoped roles. A route-by-route permission audit (all 75 handlers) also confirmed no admin API is Owner-exclusive today — plain `ADMIN` walks the same surface — so hierarchy was carried by labels and identity (env bootstrap), not by permissions.

**Decision**: **Display-layer rename only; DB role keys frozen** (zero migration). A single `ROLE_LABELS` map in `lib/constants.ts` is the source of truth for human-facing names: SUPER_ADMIN→**Owner**, ADMIN→**Manager**, INVENTORY_MANAGER→Inventory Manager, ORDER_MANAGER→Orders Manager, CONTENT_MANAGER→Content Manager, STAFF→**Floor Staff**, CUSTOMER→Customer. The admin shell (sidebar badge + "Signed in as" chip) renders from the map, and the seeded/bootstrapped owner account is named "Store Owner". Owner-shaped vocabulary now exists so any future Owner-exclusive surface (settings, staff management) can be fenced on top without another naming pass.

**Rejected**: renaming the Prisma role strings (breaking churn across API gates, audits and seed for cosmetics); labelling plain ADMIN "Admin" (keeps the exact manager/owner confusion the owner flagged); per-component label strings instead of one map (drift risk).

## D-10 · 2026-09-27 · Stock monitor: staff observe-and-report, two-man-rule corrections

**Context**: Task 17's research draft (`docs/STOCK-MONITOR-RESEARCH.md`) parked the stock-monitor build pending owner answers to §9. The owner green-lit the build ("okay remember we talked about stock management panel"); since no per-question answers came back, the draft's recommended options were adopted as recorded defaults (§9 of the research doc now logs each decision + rationale).

**Decision**: (1) **Persona** — new `STAFF` role with wall + history + count + proposals only; `ADMIN_ROLES` is unchanged so every existing admin API remains closed to STAFF, and the panel layout fences STAFF sessions to `/admin/stock-monitor*` via an `x-pathname` header the proxy now injects (server-side redirect, not just nav hiding). (2) **Corrections are propose→approve** — employees never mutate stock; approvals (and count-variance applies) write through the SAME transactional `Inventory`+`InventoryMovement` ledger as the inventory console, with the request/line marked applied and audited. WRONG_LOCATION is a delta-0 acknowledgement (flag report, no movement). (3) **Count sessions snapshot expected quantities at open** (scope JSON) so later catalog edits can't skew an in-flight count; scope caps at 500 SKUs. (4) **Kiosk wall mode** ships in v1 (cheap, scenario #4 from research); WhatsApp OUT/LOW alerts and phone-camera barcode scanning stay parked (owner notification rules + hardware scope, not needed for the observe-and-report loop). (5) On-demand counting only — no cadence scheduler.

**Rejected**: reusing `INVENTORY_MANAGER` for juniors (no way to grant view-only); letting the monitor write stock directly (breaks the audit model); a separate bin-location/trend-rollup schema in v1 (v2 candidates, research doc §6).

## D-9 · 2026-09-27 · Dark mode is a manual toggle and a token-only theme

**Context**: Request was "clean trust themed dark mode (on switch)". Two failure modes to avoid: an off-brand dark palette (the stock `.dark` block was warm-brown, not pine), and scattered `dark:` patches as the only mechanism.

**Decision**: (1) **Manual switch only** — `next-themes` with `defaultTheme="light"`, `enableSystem={false}`: the light editorial theme stays the brand's first impression; dark is opt-in via the nav toggle (storefront header ≥sm + mobile drawer "Appearance" row; admin operator header), persisted in localStorage. (2) **Token-first**: the `.dark` block is a re-tuned trust-pine palette — pine-forest `#0e1513` surfaces (never pure black), mist text, mint-pine `#7fc4ab` actions, brightened brass — so every var-driven component adapts with zero per-page work. (3) The only sanctioned `dark:` utilities are recipes for the hand-tinted status/count chips and slight `brightness` dims on cover photography (convention 10 in technical-documentation.md).

**Rejected**: system-preference auto-dark as default (the designed light experience would stop being the first impression); pure-black surfaces (harsh, off-brand); heavy CSS photo filters beyond a slight dim.

## D-8 · 2026-09-27 · Responsive hardening at the primitive level, verified by repeatable sweeps

**Context**: The whole-site responsive audit found the *same class* of bug in several unrelated places: grid/flex items defaulting to `min-width:auto` sized themselves to a wide table's min-content and blew out horizontally at 375px (shipping-policy 641px, admin dashboard 331px, admin/returns 53px).

**Decision**: Fix the class, not just the instances — `ui/card.tsx` base carries `min-w-0`, `ui/tabs.tsx` TabsList carries `max-w-full overflow-x-auto no-scrollbar`, PageShell grids always declare a base `grid-cols-1` with `min-w-0` columns, and bare text runs inside flex `<li>`s get wrapped in `<span>`. Regression safety is a script, not memory: `scripts/responsive-sweep.sh` + `responsive-sweep-admin.sh` measure `documentElement.scrollWidth` on every route × 375/768/1280 and must report 0px (harness note: the working agent-browser syntax is `set viewport`, not `viewport`).

**Rejected**: per-page one-off patches (the same bug reappears on the next page); a global `* { min-width: 0 }` (masks real layout intent and breaks intentional overflow).

## D-7 · 2026-09-27 · Parallax is transform-only, editorial-only, reduced-motion-safe

**Context**: Request was "parallax all over pages". The naive versions are harmful: `background-attachment: fixed` breaks on iOS Safari; animating layout properties forces reflow jank; scroll-jacked libraries add weight; and data-dense surfaces (catalog, cart, admin tables) get slower and harder to scan.

**Decision**: All scroll motion lives in `src/components/motion/parallax.tsx` and is (a) **transform-only** (`translate3d`/`scale` — compositor-driven, no reflow), (b) **overscaled** (backdrops render at 1.15–1.18 so drift never reveals edges), (c) **reduced-motion-safe** (every primitive drops translation/scale and keeps full opacity under `prefers-reduced-motion` — verified under emulation), and (d) **editorial-surfaces-only**: home hero, kit band, promo strip, the PageShell header band on all 9 content pages, and blog covers. Catalog/PDP/cart/checkout/account and all admin panels stay motion-quiet by contract (header comment in the primitives file + convention 9 in technical-documentation.md).

**Rejected**: site-wide parallax including functional surfaces (usability/perf cost, no conversion benefit); `background-attachment: fixed` (iOS breakage); scroll-hijack libraries (Lenis/GSAP-class) — framer-motion `useScroll`/`useTransform` was already in the bundle.

## D-6 · 2026-09-27 · Shipping webhook auth = shared secret, not HMAC

**Context**: `POST /api/webhooks/shipping` (carrier tracking events) accepted unauthenticated POSTs — anyone who guessed an AWB could push `DELIVERED`. Razorpay-style HMAC isn't available: Shiprocket/Delhivery webhooks don't sign bodies the way Razorpay does.

**Decision**: optional shared-secret token (`SHIPPING_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`), presented as `x-webhook-token` header or `?token=`. Set → enforced (401 otherwise). Unset → sandbox posture, accept but `console.warn` per request so production-without-token is visible in logs immediately. Documented in `.env.example`, env guides and PRODUCTION-CHECKLIST.

**Rejected**: IP allow-listing (carrier egress IPs are not stable/documented); no-auth-with-obscurity (the actual hole).

## D-5 · 2026-09-27 · recordAudit self-heals stale sessions instead of failing

**Context**: admin sessions carry `userId`; a DB reseed invalidates them against the `AuditLog.userId` FK → every admin audit write silently vanished (caught by try/catch). Discovered during the reviews round.

**Decision**: on Prisma `P2003`, retry once **without** `userId`, embedding the dropped id in `details.auditUserIdDropped` + `console.warn`. The trail (action/entity/details) matters more than attribution. Sessions self-heal on next login; no per-request DB session validation added (cost not justified while JWTs are signed + httpOnly and every page/API already resolves role).

## D-4 · 2026-09-27 · Reviews are moderated by default; PDP shows approved-only

**Context**: reviews schema already had `isApproved` default false, but no admin surface existed — submissions could never go live.

**Decision**: `/admin/reviews` moderation console (Pending default tab, approve/un-publish/delete, audit-logged). PDP keeps `isApproved: true` filter. Verified-purchase chip renders from `isVerified` (order-derived). Deleted reviews are hard deletes (spam/abuse) with audit trail.

## D-3 · 2026-09-26 · Product cards bind OOS at product level, PDP at variant level

**Context**: variant `inStock` on cards would show "out of stock" for purchasable products (any in-stock variant).

**Decision**: cards = product-level availability (cheapest variant drives price); OOS + notify-me lives on the PDP variant selector. Matches Amazon/Flipkart convention. Future toggle if the owner wants variant-aware cards.

## D-2 · 2026-09-26 · Plain role=tablist button groups over Radix Tabs in admin

**Context**: Radix Tabs activation proved unreproducible under automation QA and duplicated an existing pattern.

**Decision**: all admin tab UIs (orders console, trade desk, GSTR-1, reviews) use the shared plain-button `role="tablist"` pattern. Consistency + testability over component variety.

## D-1 · 2026-09-25 · Phone normalization: strip prefixes only when unambiguous

**Context**: `+91 98765 43210` paste produced `+919198765432` (old code kept the FIRST 10 digits).

**Decision**: `localPhoneFromInput()` strips `91` only when total digits ≥ 12, strips leading `0` only when ≥ 11, then takes the LAST 10. Shared by OTP login, checkout, address book. Guest `track` remains phone-as-credential with hard rate limits + sanitized projections (documented posture).
