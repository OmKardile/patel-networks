# Patel Networks / MegaTechzy — Render Deployment Runbook (Neon Postgres)

> **STATUS (Task 46): RE-DEPLOYING** — the original live service
> (`patelnetworks.onrender.com`) is retired; a fresh Render service is being
> cut against **OmKardile/patel-networks** and its URL will be announced here.
> (Node runtime, Blueprint build commands, Neon Postgres). Free plan: the
> service sleeps after ~15 idle minutes — first visit wakes it in ~50 s.

The stack on Render is a **single Node web service** with an **external Neon
Postgres** database. Nothing is stored on Render's disk, so free-plan
restarts lose no data. `render.yaml` in the repo root encodes everything
below — the Blueprint path is the fastest.

Two paths: **A. Blueprint (recommended, ~5 min)** or **B. Manual web service**.

---

## 0. Prerequisites (all done)

- ✅ Neon database provisioned, schema pushed, seeded (Task 27). If you ever
  need to redo it: `bun run db:push` then `bun run db:seed` with
  `DATABASE_URL` pointing at Neon.
- ✅ Repo builds with `npm` (package-lock.json committed, lockfileVersion 3).
- ✅ `render.yaml` Blueprint committed.
- Seeded logins: **owner** `superadmin@patelnetworks.in` / `patel@admin2026`,
  staff demos per `docs/README.md`, test customer `+91 98765 43210`.

## A. Blueprint deploy

1. Render Dashboard → **New + → Blueprint** → pick this repo (region
   **Singapore**, branch **main**, plan **Free** come pre-set from
   `render.yaml` — change plan to Starter for always-on client demos).
2. **Zero creation prompts** — every env value is hardcoded in
   `render.yaml` (owner directive, Task 49-b):

   | Variable | Hardcoded value | Notes |
   |---|---|---|
   | `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@ep-XXXXX-…neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require` | **THE ONE LINE TO EDIT.** Paste the real string from Neon Dashboard → Connection Details over the placeholder (keep `?sslmode=require`; Prisma tolerates `channel_binding=require`). Deploying with the placeholder fails at `db:sync` (P1012 / auth error). |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | `https://patelnetworks.onrender.com` | Matches the service name; if Render appends a suffix (name taken), set the real URL and run **Clear build cache & deploy**. |
   | `JWT_SECRET` | 64-hex value committed in `render.yaml` | Stable across deploys; rotating logs out every session + voids OTPs. Rotate if repo trust boundary changes. |
   | `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `superadmin@patelnetworks.in` / `patel@admin2026` | Disaster-recovery bootstrap parity; DB is pre-seeded with the same owner account. |
   | `NODE_VERSION` / `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` / `NODE_ENV` | `22` / `false` / `production` | Build pins (devDeps guarantee, prerender posture). |

   ⚠️ **Public-repo posture**: the values live in a public file — accepted
   for staging/demo (production is the client's VPS with private env,
   `deploy/DEPLOY-STEPS.md`).

   **Optional integration keys** (Razorpay / Shiprocket / SMS / WhatsApp /
   GSTIN / support WhatsApp) stay commented in `render.yaml` — no real
   credentials exist yet. Leave unset: every integration detects missing
   credentials and runs its documented deterministic simulation. Add them
   later in Dashboard → Environment when the client provides keys
   (fill-in order: `deploy/ENV-SETUP.md`).
3. **Apply** → first build runs
   `npm install && npm run db:sync && npm run build`, then starts
   `npm run start` — which pins `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 PORT=${PORT:-3000}` before
   launching `node .next/standalone/server.js` (Task 29: Render injects its
   own `HOSTNAME`; without the pin the server binds an unreachable interface
   → 502).
4. Verify: open `https://<service>.onrender.com/api/health` →
   `{"ok":true,"data":{"status":"healthy","db":"up",...}}`, then log into
   `/admin/login` with the owner credentials.

## B. Manual web service (same result, no render.yaml)

1. **New + → Web Service** → connect the repo.
2. Runtime **Node**; Build command:
   `npm install && npm run db:sync && npm run build`; Start command:
   `npm run start`; Instance type: Free (or Starter for client demos).
3. Environment → add the same variables as the table above (`JWT_SECRET`:
   generate a value with `openssl rand -hex 32`).
4. Create Web Service → verify as in A.4.

## After the first deploy

- **Fix `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`** if you guessed it: Environment → set the real
  `https://<service>.onrender.com` → *Manual Deploy → Clear build cache &
  deploy* (client bundles bake it in at build time).
- **Custom domain**: Render → Settings → Custom Domains → point the CNAME,
  then set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to the domain and redeploy once.
- **Schema changes** (later rounds): push the branch — `db:sync` in the build
  applies additive changes automatically. Destructive changes fail the build
  on purpose (`prisma db push` without `--accept-data-loss`); apply those
  manually from the Render Shell (`npx prisma db push`) after reviewing.
- **Reseed** (optional, wipes catalog + users): Render Shell → `npm run db:seed`.

## Known postures & caveats

- **Free plan spin-down**: after ~15 idle minutes the service sleeps; the
  next visit wakes it in ~50 s. For a client demo, either click the link a
  minute before the call or run on Starter. Neon free tier also cold-starts
  (~1 s first query).
- **Ephemeral disk**: nothing persistent lives on Render (DB is Neon, images
  are URL-based) — restarts are safe by design.
- **Connection pooling**: a long-running Node server holds a small Prisma
  pool on the direct Neon endpoint — fine on free tier. If you ever scale to
  many instances, switch `DATABASE_URL` to Neon's **pooled** host
  (`...-pooler.<region>.aws.neon.tech`).
- **Simulations stay on until real keys are set**: payments/OTP/shipping run
  in their documented deterministic-simulation modes (see
  `deploy/ENV-SETUP.md` for the fill-in order when the client provides keys).
- **No .env on Render, ever**: the repo is public and `.env*` is git-ignored;
  the service reads only the dashboard/blueprint environment (with-env.sh
  passes it through when no `.env` exists). `render.yaml` hardcodes the full
  core env surface (Task 49-b) — treat it as the env source of truth.

## Troubleshooting quick map

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
|---|---|
| **Build green but the site 502s** | Next standalone bound to Render's injected `HOSTNAME` (service hostname — unreachable). Fixed in-repo since Task 29: `npm run start` pins `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 PORT=${PORT:-3000}`. If the dashboard Start Command was customized, it must also carry `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 PORT=$PORT` (the verified variant `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 PORT=$PORT NODE_ENV=production bun .next/standalone/server.js` works — bun ships in Render's Node image). Full post-mortem: [docs/incidents/2026-09-27-render-502-proxy-unreachable.md](../docs/incidents/2026-09-27-render-502-proxy-unreachable.md). |
| Build fails at `db:sync` with **P1012 "Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL"** | The env var is not set on the Render service (build ran the passthrough path because there is no `.env` on Render). Render → your service → **Environment** → add `DATABASE_URL` = Neon connection string → **Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit**. (Task 28 made the script .env-first when a `.env` exists and passthrough otherwise — on Render only the dashboard value can supply it.) |
| Build fails at `db:sync` (any other reason) | Destructive schema change pending → run `npx prisma db push` from the Render Shell after review. |
| `P1001 can't reach database` | Wrong `DATABASE_URL` / Neon compute suspended → check the Neon Dashboard, keep `sslmode=require`. |
| Login works but next request logs out | `JWT_SECRET` changed between deploys → it must stay stable (Blueprint `generateValue` keeps it). |
| Pages show old domain in OG/canonicals | `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is build-time → clear cache & redeploy after changing. |
| `npm ci`/install version drift | package-lock.json is the source of truth — commit it whenever package.json changes. |

### Precedence rule (one mental model, both worlds)

`scripts/with-env.sh` (used by `dev`, `db:push`, `db:sync`, `db:seed`) loads
`.env` **over** the inherited environment when a `.env` file exists (sandbox —
its session injects a stale SQLite URL), and passes the inherited environment
through untouched when it doesn't (Render — dashboard env only). If you ever
add a new DB-touching script, route it through the shim.
