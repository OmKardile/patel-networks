              Online payments are processed by <strong className="font-semibold">Razorpay</strong> (UPI, cards,
              netbanking). Payment instruments are entered on Razorpay&apos;s PCI-DSS compliant infrastructure —
              Patel Networks does not collect or store card numbers, CVVs or UPI credentials. We receive and store
              only the payment confirmation identifiers needed to reconcile your order.

              For institutional orders settled by NEFT/RTGS, the bank transfer details are shared on request for
              orders above online limits; we store the invoice reference, not your banking credentials.

              Order-critical updates — confirmation, dispatch with tracking, out-for-delivery — are sent to the
              mobile number on the order by WhatsApp or SMS. By placing an order you consent to these transactional
              messages on that number. Marketing is opt-in and separate: we do not add buyers to promotional lists
              without their explicit consent.

              Order, invoice and tax records are retained for the period required by Indian tax law (GST records are
              conventionally kept for 72 months); account data is kept while your account is active and for a short
              period after deletion requests for legal reconciliation. Inventory audit logs are retained as part of
              the store&apos;s financial controls.

              Sessions use signed, HTTP-only cookies; passwords do not exist for customers — sign-in is by
              time-limited OTP to your registered number.
