              for CP Plus, Hikvision and Dahua cameras and recorders; 3 years for WD Purple drives — the binding
              period is printed on each product page and invoice). Beyond the 7-day DOA replacement window described
              in the return policy, remedies for defects are those the manufacturer provides through its service
              network. To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability for any order is limited to the invoice
              value of the goods supplied under it, and we are not liable for consequential losses — including loss
              of recorded footage, site downtime or third-party claims — arising from product use.
