            <p>
              Patel Networks began as a trade counter serving electricians and security contractors in Surat&apos;s
              commercial hardware market, and grew into a focused distribution business under the MegaTechzy name. The
              trade is specific: cameras, recorders, surveillance-rated storage, cable, connectors and the networking
              hardware that ties a site together. We do not sell general electronics — depth in one category is the
              service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Customers are of two kinds. Walk-in and online retail buyers fitting a shop, office, home or farm need a
              working kit at a fair price — recorder, cameras, drive, cable — which is why the site offers a guided{" "}
              <Link href="/kit-builder" className="underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-foreground">
                kit builder
              </Link>{" "}
              that assembles a compatible set in five steps. Installers and system integrators buying for client sites
              need repeatable SKUs, GST invoices that survive an accountant&apos;s review, and stock positions they can
              trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both kinds of customer get the same operating standard: genuine goods from authorized supply, honest
              stock numbers, same-day carrier handover for paid orders before the {STORE.dispatchCutoff} cutoff, and a
              warranty process built on serial numbers rather than goodwill.

              Surveillance hardware is warranted by its manufacturer, and manufacturers settle claims by serial
              number. So serials are captured for warranty-bearing items at the moment of dispatch and stored against
              the order line. When something fails inside the warranty window, the replacement claim is matched to the
              exact unit that shipped — which is also what our{" "}
