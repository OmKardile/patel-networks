# Technical documentation (hub)

Single entry point for engineers. Deep dives live in `docs/`; this file stays the accurate overview.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 App Router, React 19 | All mutations via **route handlers** (no server actions) |
| Language | TypeScript 5 (strict) | |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui (New York) | Reference-derived light theme (default) + token-only dark mode via `.dark` tokens (manual toggle — decisions.md D-9, re-based to the reference DNA in D-16) |
| DB | Prisma 6 · **PostgreSQL (Neon) in dev + prod** | Portable schema: no enums, no `String[]`, money = integer paise. SQLite remains a documented fallback (flip provider + `file:` URL). |
| Auth | Phone-OTP (customers) · email+password scrypt (admins) | JWT in httpOnly cookies, `secure` in prod |
| Cache/state | Local memory caching, Zustand (client islands) | No Redis by design |
| Runtime | bun | `bun run dev` on :3000 |

## Architecture in one page

```
src/
  app/
    (store)/          ← 32 storefront page files (catalog, PDP, cart, checkout, account, track…)
    admin/
      login/          ← standalone login (outside panel chrome)
      (panel)/        ← 15 console pages, server-layout gated + role badges
    api/              ← 80 route files (all mutations; Zod-validated DTOs)
  components/
    storefront/       ← product cards, gallery, variant selector, cart, reviews…
    admin/            ← client islands per console module + shared shell
    motion/           ← parallax primitives (ParallaxImage, ScrollDrift, Drift,
    |                    HeroDecor, BandDecor) — currently unused on the
    |                    motion-quiet storefront; editorial/admin only (D-7/D-16)
  server/services/    ← business logic (orders, inventory, shipping, payments,
  |                      notifications, catalog, reports, auth); the ONLY place
  |                      that talks to Prisma besides thin API reads
  lib/                ← session, api-helpers (ok/fail/requireRole), validators,
  |                      money, phone, pincodes, rate-limit, constants
prisma/schema.prisma  ← 39 models · prisma/seed.ts + seed-images.json (real images only)
scripts/              ← qa-fixtures.ts / qa-clean.ts / checkdb.ts / rma-e2e.sh
  |                    / responsive-sweep.sh + responsive-sweep-admin.sh
```

**Request flow**: page/handler → service (auth context resolved first) → Prisma → `{ok,data}` envelope via `ok()`/`fail()`.

## Conventions that must not drift

1. **Money is integer paise** everywhere (DB, API, logic). Convert to ₹ only at render (`paiseToRupees`).
2. **`{ok, data}` envelope** on every API route; errors via `fail(msg, status, issues?)`.
3. **All mutations are route handlers** with Zod schemas from `src/lib/validators.ts`.
4. **Status FSMs live server-side** with forward-only ranks + audit records (orders, returns, inquiries, shipments).
5. **Case-insensitive search**: the runtime DB is PostgreSQL, so `mode:'insensitive'` is available; existing search code predates the switch (no contains-mode usage). If the SQLite fallback is ever restored, remember `mode:'insensitive'` breaks there — the schema portability guarantees (no enums/native arrays, integer paise) still stand.
6. **No AI-generated images.** Seed images indexed in `prisma/seed-images.json`.
7. **Audit**: state-changing admin actions call `recordAudit(action, entity, id, details, userId)` (self-heals stale sessions — see decisions.md D-3).
8. Client islands use the app's plain `role="tablist"` button-group pattern (not Radix Tabs) for consistency.
9. **Motion contract**: scroll effects live in `src/components/motion/parallax.tsx` — transform-only, reduced-motion-safe, and only on editorial surfaces (heroes, bands, covers). Catalog/PDP/cart/checkout/account/admin data panels stay motion-quiet. `ui/Card` carries `min-w-0` and `ui/TabsList` carries `max-w-full overflow-x-auto` as permanent anti-blowout hardening; PageShell grids always declare a base `grid-cols-1`. Responsive regressions are caught by `scripts/responsive-sweep.sh` + `responsive-sweep-admin.sh` (0px horizontal overflow required at 375/768/1280).
10. **Theme contract**: light is the brand default; dark mode is manual-only (`next-themes`, class strategy, `defaultTheme="light"`, `enableSystem={false}`) toggled from the storefront header / mobile drawer / admin operator header, persisted in localStorage. The `.dark` block in globals.css is the single source of the trust-pine night palette — new components must use semantic tokens (`bg-background`, `text-muted-foreground`, …), never hard-coded light colors; the only sanctioned `dark:` utilities are chip recipes and slight photo dims.

## Auth model

| Surface | Mechanism | Rate limits |
|---|---|---|
| Customer | OTP to phone; JWT cookie `pn_session` | OTP: 3/phone/window + 12/IP/window; verify attempts capped |
| Admin | email+password (scrypt N=16384,r=8,p=1); JWT cookie `pn_admin_session`; role bootstrap via `ADMIN_EMAIL/PASSWORD` | Login 8 / 10 min / email |
| Cookies | httpOnly, `sameSite=lax`, `secure` in prod | Role isolation: admin login clears customer cookie and vice versa |

RBAC (D-12): two operator roles — `SUPER_ADMIN` (**Owner**, implicitly passes every gate; can change own login and mint more owners) and `STAFF` (scope = `User.permissions` JSON, 15 validated keys: orders, returns, products, categories, brands, inventory, stock_monitor, customers, inquiries, reviews, coupons, banners, blog, reports, settings). Gates are `requirePermission(scope)` / `requireOwner()` in `api-helpers` — they **re-read the user row per request**, so owner edits apply on the staff's next request (no re-login). Fixed legacy roles (`ADMIN`, `INVENTORY_MANAGER`, `ORDER_MANAGER`, `CONTENT_MANAGER`) are removed; `scripts/migrate-legacy-roles.ts` migrates old rows idempotently. The panel layout mirrors the gates server-side via the proxy's `x-pathname` header (deep links into non-granted sections bounce to the staff's first granted section; `/admin` dashboard = Owner / scope-less staff only; dead-JWT sessions route through `GET /admin/logout` to clear the cookie — prevents proxy↔layout redirect loops). Route → scope map lives in `(panel)/layout.tsx` SECTIONS; stock-monitor decision endpoints (variance apply, request decide, session close) require the `inventory` scope, observation/reporting requires `stock_monitor`.

## Integrations (dual-mode)

Each integration is **live when real credentials exist, deterministic simulation otherwise** — no fabricated success (`{simulated:true}` is surfaced):

- **Razorpay**: live orders + HMAC signature webhook verification; simulate path for sandbox.
- **Shiprocket/Delhivery**: live AWBs/labels; simulated `DELH<10hex>` AWBs, zone-based ETAs. Tracking webhook now token-gated (`SHIPPING_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`).
- **SMS (Fast2SMS shape, DLT)**: live dispatch or `[SIMULATED SMS]` lines in server logs.
- **WhatsApp Cloud API (Meta)**: 7 canonical templates (order confirm, shipped, delivered, refund, RMA update, back-in-stock, address_updated) or simulated audit records.

## Data & migrations

- Dev: `bun run db:push`; restore catalog any time with `bun run db:seed`.
- Prod: `RUN_MIGRATIONS=true` runs `prisma migrate deploy` in the container entrypoint; provider switch is one line (`provider = "postgresql"`), documented in `docs/VPS-SETUP-GUIDE.md`.
- Backups: `deploy/backup.sh` (cron-able) + `.env` vault copy off-box.

## Verification gates (every round)

`bun run lint` (0) · `bunx tsc --noEmit` (0) · `GET /api/health` → `db:up` · agent-browser E2E pass of changed flows · 0 console errors · `bash scripts/responsive-sweep.sh` + `-admin.sh` → 0px overflow @375/768/1280 (after any layout work).

**Docs duty (standing user contract)**: every shipped change updates `changelog.md` plus any affected md (`compact.md`, `decisions.md`, `technical-documentation.md`, `help.md`, `docs/*`) **in the same round** — documentation never lags code.
