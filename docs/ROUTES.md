# Patel Networks / MegaTechzy — Routes cheat sheet

> **The one file to check when you can't remember a URL.** Page routes (storefront + admin), login pages, seeded credentials, and the API group map. Full API handler catalog with methods/shapes: [`API.md`](./API.md).

---

## 1 · Logins (the part you keep needing)

### Operators (Owner + Staff) — ONE login page for everyone

**`/admin/login`** — email + password. The account's role decides where you land:

| Who | Email | Password | Lands on | Sees |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Owner** (super admin) | `superadmin@patelnetworks.in` | `patel@admin2026` | `/admin` (full console) | Everything, incl. Staff & access |
| Staff — Stock Monitor persona | `staff@patelnetworks.in` | `counter@2026` | `/admin/stock-monitor` | Stock Monitor only |
| Staff — Warehouse persona | `inventory@patelnetworks.in` | `warehouse@2026` | first granted section | scopes set in wizard |
| Staff — Fulfillment persona | `orders@patelnetworks.in` | `fulfill@2026` | first granted section | scopes set in wizard |
| Staff — Content persona | `content@patelnetworks.in` | `content@2026` | first granted section | scopes set in wizard |

- Staff scopes are **DB-fresh** (D-12): the owner edits them in `/admin/staff` and they apply on the staff's **next request — no re-login needed**.
- A scoped staff typing a URL outside their grant gets bounced server-side to their first granted section.
- Stale session escape hatch: **`/admin/logout`** (GET — clears the JWT even if the account was wiped/recreated).
- Owner bootstrap fallback (empty DB): `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env.

### Customers — phone + OTP (no passwords)

| Route | What |
|---|---|
| **`/account/login`** | The real OTP sign-in (request code → verify) |
| `/login` | Convenience alias → redirects to `/account/login` (preserves `?next=`) |

Test customer in sandbox/demo: phone **`+91 98765 43210`** — the OTP prints to `dev.log` as `[SIMULATED SMS]` (sandbox) or is sent by the SMS provider when keys are configured.

### Guest order tracking (no login)

**`/track`** — order number + phone as credential (rate-limited).

## 5 · API routes — group map

| Group | Covers |
|---|---|
| `/api/auth/**` | Customer OTP request/verify, session me/logout |
| `/api/admin/auth/**` | Operator login/logout |

| `/api/products/**` · `/api/search` · `/api/reviews` | Catalog, autocomplete, review submit |
| `/api/coupon/**` · `/api/shipping/**` | Coupon validation · rates/serviceability |
| `/api/orders/**` · `/api/track` | Placement, history, public tracking |
| `/api/payments/**` | Razorpay create/verify (+ sandbox simulate) |
| `/api/stock-alerts` | Back-in-stock notify-me |
| `/api/admin/**` | The whole operations console (orders, inventory, staff, reports, GSTR-1, …) |

*Page routes mirror the folder tree 1:1 (`src/app/(store)/**`, `src/app/admin/**`), so if a route isn't listed here, the folder name is the URL. Keep this file updated when adding top-level sections.*
